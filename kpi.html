About KPIs
==========

The KPI service offers real-time performance indicators.

KPI Kinds
---------

KPI Kinds are objects that represent _what_ value is computed, regardless on
_on what_ that value is computed. Examples of KPI kinds include _Specimens Held_
and _Connections in the “Off” status_.

KPI kinds are definitions.

KPIs
----

KPIs are objects that represent an actual value, ie represent both _what_ is
computed and _on what_ it is computed. Examples of KPIs include
_Specimens Held for Architect_.

As such a KPI is usually identified by a KPI kind (what is computed) and a
resource (on what it is computed).

Note however that the KPI service does not mandate that all KPIs are identified
by that (kind, resource) couple. Some variations may include:

* A KPI may be so generic or so particular that there is no KPI kind that
  describes it. Such KPIs cannot be computed by LabX, but a custom client may
  upload values for it.

* A KPI may apply to something that is not a resource. Again, such KPIs cannot
  be computed by LabX.

KPIs as resources
-----------------

A KPI in LabX is, at its core, a process that computes a value. As such, it is
the answer to "_who_ computed that value?" and therefore a resource (as any
other process).

Obtaining the list of available KPIs
------------------------------------

The client can obtain the list of known KPIs by querying the REST resource:

    http://server/api/kpi/1.0/kpis

This possibly returns a huge list of KPIs. The search can be further restricted
by including query parameters `resource=«resource-id»` or `kind=«kpi-kind-id»`.

The client should select the interesting KPIs and remember which ones need
to be displayed, by recording their internal ids.

Creating and auto-creating KPIs
-------------------------------

The client can create general KPIs by issuing POST queries to

    http://server/api/kpi/1.0/kpis

Generally, it is simpler to auto-create KPIs with the simplified interface,
which only works for standard KPIs (ie those that explicitly apply to a
resource).

To retrieve (and optionally auto-create) a given KPI, issue a GET query to

    http://server/api/kpi/1.0/resources/«resourceid»/setup/«kpi-kind-id»

The KPI is created if needed, and its properties are initialized to sensible
defaults. It is possible to omit the `kpi-kind-id` parameter, in which case all
KPIs applicable to the resource are auto-created and returned as an array.

Configuring KPIs
----------------

The client can configure KPIs by using the

    http://server/api/kpi/1.0/kpis/«kpi-id»

REST resource, issuing GET and PUT queries. Additional KPIs can be defined
by issuing POST requests.

Obtaining the current value of a KPI
------------------------------------

The client can obtain the current value of a KPI by querying the REST
resource:

    http://server/api/kpi/1.0/currentvalues/«kpi-id»

By omitting the `kpi-id` parameter, it is possible to obtain a an array of
values. The list is subject to paging, and can be filtered with `resource` and
`kind` filters as query parameters.

A client may also filter the set of returned values by giving a
semicolon-separated list of ids in the `ids` query parameter. KPIs with the
given ids are returned as an array. Bear in mind that:

  - The returned array is not necessarily in the same order as the `ids` list.
    The client must identify the KPIs by their internal ids, not by their
    position in the returned array.
  - The returned array may contain less elements than the `ids` list. This may
    occur if KPIs are filtered or not accessible for the current user.

Setting the current value of a KPI
----------------------------------

When an external agent knows the value of a KPI, it can publish it by issuing
a PUT query to:

    http://server/api/kpi/1.0/currentvalues/«kpi-id»

Note that typically, only KPI computers should directly set the value of a KPI.
Ordinary processes should instead feed values to _metrics_.

Automatic computation of the KPI value
--------------------------------------

The value of most KPIs are computed from the values of metrics. Instead of
recomputing the value each time it is requested, the framework caches the
value for a given amount of time, and schedules recomputations in the background.

Since the recomputations are only scheduled when the KPI value is actively
requested, there may be long periods of time when the KPI value is not computed
althoug metric values change. A KPI value therefore becomes _stale_ if it was
not computed for a long time.

As a result, when a KPI value is queried for the first time after a long period
of inactivity, the returned value will be stale, and the client should perform
a second query after a few seconds to obtain a valid value.

Each KPI kind indicates how long a computed value remains valid. The KPI is
automatically recomputed when queried and half of its validity period has
elapsed.

The KPI services uses the `validuntil` property to provide a hint to the client
as to when a value will become invalid due to being stale.

The experimental option `recompute` allows the client to indicate whether or not
a recomputation should be scheduled.

Experimental option `wait` allows the client to indicate that it wants the KPI
service to wait for the new value to be computed before returning a response.

Error and Warning ranges
------------------------

Each KPI defines acceptable, warning and error ranges. Each range defines
a low and high threshold. Values outside the range trigger the corresponding
status:

  - A value outside the error range is reported as in error.
  - A value inside the error range but outside the warning range is
    reported as being a warning.
  - A value inside the warning range is reported as being normal or acceptable.

Thresholds are _inclusive_. If the warning range is 0 to 3, a value of 3 is _inside_
the warning range (ie reported as acceptable).

There are two places where thresholds are defined : in each individual KPI, and
in the KPI kinds.

When a threshold is NULL in an individual KPI, the value from the KPI kind is
used instead.

A value of NULL (in both the KPI and the KPI kind) indicates that this threshold
is not checked. For example, a
NULL value for the error high threshold indicates that arbitrary high values
are never reported as errors.

Cases where the ranges are not properly setup have undefined behavior; the
reported state is implementation dependant and may vary depending on external
conditions. These invalid setups include:

  - The High threshold being less than the Low threshold
  - The warning range not being a subset of the error range.

Examples of KPI thresholds
--------------------------

ErrorLow == null, WarningLow == null, WarningHigh = 5, ErrorHigh = 10

This is the case where we expect low values for a KPI, and high values are not
desirable. Values from 0 to 5 will be reported as OK, from 6 to 10 are reported
as warning / cautionary, and values 11 and above are reported as error.

ErrorLow == null, WarningLow == null, WarningHigh = 10, ErrorHigh = 10

This is the same case as before, but values from 0 to 10 are OK, and values
11 and above are errors. There is no warning / cautionary range.

Note : In such a case, avoid putting a NULL in the WarningHigh value. This
would simply re-use whatever value is setup for the KPI kind.

ErrorLow = 70, WarningLow = 85, WarningHigh = null, ErrorHigh = null

This is the case where we expect high values, and low values are not desirable.
Values from 85 to 100 will report as OK, 70 to 84 as warning, and anything 69 or
below as error.

Note that if the KPI kind has a threshold, it is not possible to override it with
a null. Use a value far higher or far lower than legal value instead (eg -1 as low
or 101 as high value for a percentage)

Regular updates
---------------

The KPI service exclusively uses client polling as a way to refresh the display.
As such, clients are expected to regularly re-issue a query in order to obtain
updated values.

The KPI service uses the `refreshat` property to provide a hint to the client
as to when is the appropriate time to issue a refresh. The KPI service uses
knowledge of internal processes (such as whether a recomputation was scheduled)
to provide the best possible estimate for this value.

Composite values
----------------

There are many cases where performance values are so closely related that it
may seem interesting to group them in the same KPI as a composite value.

A typical example would be the _Connection Status_ KPI that would show the
number of connections in the “Off” state, the number of connections in the
“Error state” etc. as a structure.

KPIs do not hold composite values. All KPIs have a single, numerical or
enumerated value. The _Connection Status_ KPI is therefore composed of
multiple individual KPIs.

### Rationale

The main reason why KPIs are not grouped that way is that you would basically
have to configure each component of the group individually:

 -  Each component has a name.
 -  Each component has a range of admitted values.
 -  Each component has a history of past values, trends analysis
 -  Each component might have access restrictions depending on role or
    organization
 -  Etc.

All this is already the standard way of defining a KPI, so if a KPI was
composite, we would have to duplicate all this setup at the component level.

Having components adds complexity to the database:

 -  Storing the values as composite entities in the database makes it
    difficult to retrieve individual numerical values for trends analysis.

 -  The identity of a component would be the unique identity of the KPI + an
    abstract position. This makes for a composite identity (two components to
    store and index) instead of a simple identity.

 -  There is no intrinsic reason to limit KPI structure to simple vs composite,
    a component might itself be composite, adding even more complexity to the
    notion of "position".

 -  If a third party wants to add its own custom component, we would need to
    maintain a centralized repository of positions already in use. If we stick
    to simple identity, all we have to do is tell them to generate a new GUID,
    which is guaranteed to be unique by design.

Having components adds complexity in the client:

 -  The client must be prepared to receive less components than expected
 -  The client must be prepared to receive more components than expected
 -  The client must be prepared to receive components where some of the items
    have current values, others have stale values, or no value at all.

Having components adds complexity in the back-end:

 -  The back-end must compute all components at once, even if some of them are
    trivial to compute and others are more costly. For example, computing the
    component for connections in the "On" state is trivial (just count them),
    but computing the component of connections in the "On Request" state is not,
    since you need to ensure that some of the connections are not stuck in that
    state for too long.

 -  The back-end must compute all components, including those that the UI does
    not intend to display, unless the API is augmented to include a way to
    say what components are interesting and what parts are not. For example,
    some people would like to have a KPI that treats "Off" and "Off Request"
    the same way, while others would like to see these as two different items.
    If those values are returned in an array, the array must contain a slot
    for each of those combinations, most of them being ignored by the client.

Having components adds complexity to the API:

  - The API must contain options so the client may request only the components
    of the full KPI it intends to actually display.

  - The API must contain options to indicate what to do with components that
    cannot be computed right now.

All these caveats are solved by having each individual component be described
and queried as a standalone KPI, at the expense of chattiness.

If chattiness proves to be inefficient:

  - The client should issue all queries in parallel anyway.
  - The client may be changed to issue a query that returns all KPIs at once,
    and filter them.
  - The API can be augmented to include a "group query" that queries multiple
    items at once.
Workflows for client applications displaying data
=================================================

<a name="kpi-display-workflows"></a>

Obtaining the list of KPIs for the currently selected resource
--------------------------------------------------------------

It is expected that the user has been shown a list of connection groups. See
the Resource service, and especially the section _Workflows for client
applications displaying data_ for information about obtaining that list.

When the user has selected a connection group or individual connection
from the left side:

1.  Retrieve the corresponding internal ID as «resource-id».

2.  Auto-create (once) the list of standard KPIs for the resource:
    `GET http://server/api/kpi/1.0/resources/resource=«resource-id»/setup`
    This will auto-create all standard KPIs for the resource and return them.

      - The returned list may be empty, if the resource does not support KPIs.
      - The returned list only contains the standard KPIs for the resource,
        not all KPIs.

3.  Optionally obtain the list of all KPIs defined for the resource:
    `GET http://server/api/kpi/1.0/kpis?resource=«resource-id»`
    This will return all KPIs currently defined for the resource, including
    the nonstandard ones.

4.  Regularly obtain the values for the KPIs
    `GET http://server/api/kpi/1.0/currentvalues?resource=«resource-id»`
    This call will return an array of values. All known values are returned,
    but some might be stale (status code 3) if they were not queried for a long
    time.

      - The returned list will contain the values for all defined KPIs, not
        restricted to the standard ones.
      - Instead of filtering by resource, it is possible to query by KPI ids.
        Add the argument `?ids=a,b,c,etc" where a, b, c are the ids of the
        requested KPIs (retrieved in the previous steps)

5.  Optionally, obtain the current values one by one:
    `GET http://server/api/kpi/1.0/currentvalues/«kpi-id»`
    Where «kpi-id» is the internal ID of a KPI definition.

6.  Optionally, obtain the current values for a given resource and KPI kind:
    `GET http://server/api/kpi/1.0/currentvalues?resource=«resource-id»&kind=«kpi-kind-id»`
    Beware that this might return an empty list, or a list with more than one
    item.

Resource Kinds
--------------

KPIs add the following resource kinds to represent individual KPIs and
KPI groups.

###ResourceKind_Kpi
    GUID: '82ebb2a6-a1ee-4db6-95ca-cbc573ab8674'
The _Key Performance Indicator_ resource kind represents KPIs.
#### Rationale
KPIs are represented as resources because:
  - A LabX KPI is embodied in a process that computes a value. Processes are
 resources by definition.
  - It is now easy to group related KPIs into "KPI groups" which are a simple
 way to capture composite KPI values.
  - Using resource links, it is possible to precisely model the relative
 position of the KPIs in the organizational tree, and therefore extract
 the responsibilities for maintaining or acting on KPI values.

###ResourceKind_KpiGroup
    GUID: '65d54e2a-5f2a-4771-aafd-adb4a45b8631'
The _KPI Group_ resource kind represents a group of KPIs.
KPI groups can be used to groups related KPIs as a single entity.
