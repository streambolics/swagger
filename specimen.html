About the Specimen service
==========================

The Specimen service allows an ETL client application to upload metrics about
individual specimens, and a display client application to obtain various
statistics about those metrics.

The statistics provided by the service are usually requested by the KPI
service to precompute specimen related KPIs.
Workflows for specimen metric providers
=======================================

<a name="provider-workflows"></a>

General Principles
------------------

1.  The client retrieves the GUIDs to the connections. The procedure to do so
    is in the documentation for resources. In the specific case of IM, refer
    to the _Obtaining Connection GUIDS in the specific case of IM_ section.


2.  The client decides of the _SID Context_ that acts as a disambiguating
    context for SIDs. SID 1000 represent the same specimen in two different
    IMs if and only if their SID Context is the same. The SID and SID context
    are joined then hashed together to provide the HSID (Hashed SID) which is
    an anonymized version of the SID.

3.  The client enters a loop where metrics are computed per specimen and
    per connection, then uploaded to the cloud.
    *   At startup, all metrics for all specimens need to be computed. The user
        may trigger a full recomputation at any time.
    *   In steady state, metrics are computed for specimens that were changed.
    *   Note how this is reminiscent of initial _builds_ and regular _updates_
        in the Lab Intel cube.


Computing and uploading metrics
-------------------------------

1.  Select a specimen that needs to be updated. Obtain its SID.
2.  Join the SID with the SID Context. The client may either transmit the pair
    as is (in the `sid` and `sidcontext` properties), or pre-hash it itself and
    transmit the hash (in the `hsid` property)
3.  Compute all relevant metrics on the specimen.
4.  Push the metrics by issuing one or more POST calls to

        http://server/api/specimen/1.0/metrics

    with the payload:

        [
            {
                sid: "Specimen ID",
                sidcontext: "SID context",
                hsid: "Hashed SID (Optional - Only if sid/sidcontext absent)",
                metrics: [
                    {
                        kind: "Metric Kind (GUID)",
                        connection: "Connection (GUID)",
                        middleware: "Middleware (GUID) if known",
                        value: "Value",
                        timestamp: "Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZZZZ)"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]

    A single POST may push any number of metrics. When pushing multiple
    metrics for the same SID, it is recommended to repeat the `metrics` property
    instead of repeating the whole structure.

    The connection and middleware GUIDs are obtained from the synchronization
    step. The middleware GUID can be omitted, but should be present for
    performance reasons (so the microservice does not need to retrieve it each
    time.)

    The Metric Kind GUID is a well-known GUID obtained from the `metricids.js`
    file. What follows is a small excerpt of this file, which also defines
    precise semantics on the metrics.

        exports.MetricKind_ResultsHeld          = '91be7235-fe53-450a-b1ba-f1507b2254be';
        exports.MetricKind_CriticalResultsHeld  = '3364ff21-eaa1-4a86-9c91-8fff0f1b832c';

Example:

        [ {
                sid: "1000",
                sidcontext: "EastCoast",
                metrics: [ {
                        kind: "91be7235-fe53-450a-b1ba-f1507b2254be",
                        connection: "f4367529-bc42-4a49-9b2c-ae83ba3c3908",
                        value: "5",
                        timestamp: "2019-29-05T09:12:00-06:00"
                    },{
                        kind: "3364ff21-eaa1-4a86-9c91-8fff0f1b832c",
                        connection: "f4367529-bc42-4a49-9b2c-ae83ba3c3908",
                        value: "3",
                        timestamp: "2019-29-05T09:12:00-06:00"
                    }
                ]
            },{
                sid: "1001",
                sidcontext: "EastCoast",
                metrics: [ {
                        kind: "91be7235-fe53-450a-b1ba-f1507b2254be",
                        connection: "f4367529-bc42-4a49-9b2c-ae83ba3c3908",

This API reference is automatically extracted from the swagger documentation.
The source swagger file may contain more detailed information than this
static document.

LabX API specification.

Version: 1.0.0

## Definitions
### Count

The count of specimens, or (specimen,middleware) pairs that match the count criteria.


  - `status` *(number)* : The status of the value if considered as a source for a KPI. This should normally be empty, so the status is determined by KPI rules themselves.
  - `timestamp` *(string)* : The time at which the value was computed, empty for "just now".
  - `value` *(number)* : The count value.


## Paths

### GET /_healthcheck











Responses:

- `200`: Success

### GET /_version











Responses:

- `200`: Success

### DELETE /api/specimen/1.0/connections/(connectionid)






Deletes all metrics for the given connection.
  - Use this when retiring a connection.









### GET /api/specimen/1.0/counts/(metric)/(resource)






Counts the number of specimens for which the metric is not zero within the resource




Path Params:

  - `metric` : The internal ID of a metric kind

  - `resource` : The internal ID of a resource. The resource may be a Connection or a Connection Group.

Responses:

- `200`: The operation succeeded.
 *  The `data` property contains the requested Count
 *  The `errors` property is empty.


### POST /api/specimen/1.0/metrics






Uploads specimen-based metrics.








### GET /api/specimen/1.0/middlewarecounts/(metric)/(resource)






Counts the number of (specimen,middleware) for which the metric is not zero within the resource.





Path Params:

  - `metric` : The internal ID of a metric kind

  - `resource` : The internal ID of a resource. The resource may be a Connection or a Connection Group.

Responses:

- `200`: The operation succeeded.
 *  The `data` property contains the requested Count
 *  The `errors` property is empty.


### DELETE /api/specimen/1.0/middlewares/(middlewareid)






Deletes all metrics for the given middleware (Not currently implemented).
  - Use this when retiring a middleware.
  - This is equivalent to delete metrics for each of the connections
    defined for that middleware.
