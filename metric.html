About metrics
=============

The `metric` service maintains individual real-time metrics. These are later
combined to synthesize KPIs.

A _Metric_ represents actual value being regularly obtained.

Note that contrary to KPIs, metrics do not have _expected values_ that might
trigger an action when bounds are violated.

Metric Kinds
------------

The Metric Kind is a configuration item that indicates _what_ is being metered,
independantly on _how_ it was metered, and _on what_ it was metered.

For example the Metric Kind “IM InQ Size” indicates that we measure the size
of an Instrument Manager InQ. This can be done in a multitude of ways (the ETL
driver can upload it, an external probe can perform a query directly in Caché,
etc.)

Resource Metrics
----------------

A _resource metric_ is a metric identified by the pair (Resource, Metric Kind).
As such, their `resource` and `kind` properties are fixed.

Resource Metrics are those usually relevant for reporting the status of
resources in the lab. Their identity specifically allows them to be used in
the computation of KPIs.

  - Resource metrics do not need to be created by a `POST` query, they are
    auto-created when needed (ie when their value is set for the first time.)

  - Resource metrics do have a unique ID and can be handled as if they were
    ad-hoc metrics. The contrary is not true, you cannot handle an ad-hoc
    metric with the resource metrics API calls, even if the `resource` and
    `kind` properties are defined.

Specimen Metrics
----------------

A _Specimen Metric_ is a metric that is attached to a specimen and a connection.
These are described in the documentation for the specimen service.

Ad-hoc Metrics
--------------

An _ad-hoc metric_ is a metric in the most general sense, that cannot be
identified formally by any of its characteristics.

Although an ad-hoc metric can be linked to a resource, and can have a
metric kind, they are not formally required to do so. Also, there may be any
number of ad-hoc metrics that have the same resource and kind.

Ad-hoc metrics cannot usually be used in the computation of KPIs.

Workflows for Metric Data Providers
===================================

Setting the current value of a Resource Metric
----------------------------------------------

To set the value of a Resource Metric, issue a `PUT` query to

    http://server/api/metric/resources/:resourceid/currentvalues/:kindid

where `resourceid` is the GUID of the resource and `kindid` is the metric
kind. The kind id is usually one of the supported metric kinds (see reference
section) but the client must have some way of remembering or retrieving the
id of the resource. The documentation for the resource service describes some
simpified APIs to retrieve resource ids for middlewares and connections.

Setting the current value of an ad-hoc metric
---------------------------------------------

To set the value of an ad-hoc Metric, issue a `PUT` query to

    http://server/api/metric/currentvalues/:id

where `id` is the GUID of the ad-hoc metric. The GUID was auto-generated when
the ad-hoc metric was created. The client must have some way of storing and
retrieving that id.

Payload for the value of a metric
---------------------------------

The payload to upload a value is formatted:

    {
        value: 10
        timestamp: "2019-01-01T10:00"
        name: "InQ"
    }

  - `value` is the value of the metric. This is required and must be numeric.
  - `timestamp`: the timestamp when the value was obtained. This is optional,
    and will default to the current time if absent.
  - `name`: The name of the metric. This is optional, and only used when the
    metric is created.

Regular updates of metrics
--------------------------

When metrics are used as source for the computation of KPIs, they must be
uploaded regularly even if they did not change.

When a KPI needs to be recomputed, but the metrics involved in the computation
are too old (according to the _validity limit_ as described next) the KPI
computation fails with the error _insufficient data_.

Validity limits for metrics
---------------------------

Each metric kind defines a validity limit. This limit is only effective for
resource metrics, specimen metrics are not affected.

The validity limit of a metric is the maximum interval at which a new value
for the metric must be provided. If a metric value does not change significantly,
the ETL client may delay the upload of the value up to the validity limit.

This helps reduce the traffic between the ETL driver and the backend, but has
the adverse effect of delaying the detection of a persistent connection failure
between ETL and the backend.

The general principle for uploading a metric value is as follows:

  1. Determine the appropriate validity limit. Divide it by two to obtain the
     upload interval.
  2. Determine the rules for deciding whether a value changed significantly.
     Each metric kind has its own rules for this. Typically, a change is
     significant if the absolute delta is above a given limit, says 10, *or*
     the relative delta is above another given limit, say 15%.
  3. Loop every 15 seconds
     1. Acquire a new value
     2. If no value was never successfully uploaded, upload the new value
     3. If the new value is significantly different from the previously
        uploaded value, upload the new value
     4. If the upload interval elapsed since the last successful upload,
        upload the new value.
     5. Otherwise, do not upload the new value.

<div class="warning">
The validity limit is meant as a way to reduce bandwidth, not as a failure
detection scheme. Implementations should refrain from lowering validity limits
for every metric to act as a poor man's failure detection scheme.
</div>

Since this scheme does not allow for the detection of persistent connection
errors, there should be *one* resource metric representing the status of the
connection, and that has a very short (less than 1 minute) validity limit.
This metric should be used as watchdog for the connection status.

Bulk uploading of metrics
-------------------------

<div class="warning">
This is not supported yet. Each metric needs to be uploaded individually.
</div>

An ETL driver should attempt to group multiple metric uploads in the same
query message. To do so, during the data acquisition loop, uploads should be
queued instead of being performed individually on the spot. Once several uploads
have been queued, perform a single query to upload them all. A good value for
grouping is around 10 metrics per query.

The _Instrument Manager Out Of Service_ metric is used to report the current
Out-of-Service status of a connection. Out-of-service metric represents
the fact that the connection is marked as removed from routing. This is
different from the IMStatus_OutOfService value for ImStatus.
#### Unit
One of the values in the IMBool_* range. IMBool_True means that the
connection is marked as out-of-service, ImBool_False means the connection is
not out-of-service.
#### Target
A direct or indirect connection.
  - For indirect connections, it is recommended to mirror the status of the
 corresponding direct connection, but use the ImStatus_Indirect status
 instead of the ImStatus_On when the connection is functional. This
 indicates that the status is expected to be OK, but that cannot be
 guaranteed.

exist in multiple instances, but that we want to represent as a single
item.
#### Unit
  An integer between 0 and MetricKind_ImTotalInstances.
#### Notes
  Setting that number is not sufficient for the backend to deduce the
  status of the service. The status of the connection must also be
  reported in MetricKind_ImStatus, as usual.

<a name="a51de484-cf70-4eeb-ba05-bd262578c226"></a>
###MetricKind_ImSendQ

The _Results Auto Verified_ is used to upload the total number of results
that have the status "released" and were made so by a totally automatic
process (eg Rules in Instrument Manager).
All auto-verified results are released by definition, so this count must
always be less than or equal to
[Results Released](#cfd2146c-3697-483c-a38f-1370f0cd7f41)

Instrument Manager Status Codes
-------------------------------

<a name="5"></a>
###ImStatus_AlwaysOn
    GUID: '5'
The _Always On_ status indicates that the connection does not have
a proper status, because it is always available for technical reasons.
This is the recommented status for manual connections.

<a name="9"></a>
###ImStatus_Connecting
    GUID: '9'
The _Connecting_ status indicates that the connection is ready to communicate
with the device, but that the logical link is not yet established.
This occurs when the connection waits for the protocol to establish the
communication, including the TCP connection, the SSL/TLS negociation, and
some other token exchanges.

<a name="6"></a>
###ImStatus_Delegated
    GUID: '6'
The _Delegated_ status indicates that the connection status is OK, but
since the actual connection is delegated to another entity, that other
entity status needs to be taken into account also.
This is the recommended status for indirect connections instead of
[On](#10) when they are fully functional.

<a name="1"></a>
###ImStatus_Error
    GUID: '1'
The _Error_ status indicates that the connection is experiencing errors.

<a name="12"></a>
###ImStatus_LightPole
    GUID: '12'
The _Light Pole_ status indicates that the connection is a light pole.

<a name="13"></a>
###ImStatus_Manual
    GUID: '13'
The _Manual_ status indicates that the connection is manual, and is
always available.

<a name="14"></a>
###ImStatus_NonInterfaced
    GUID: '14'
The _Non Interfaced_ status indicates that the connection represents
an instrument that is not actually connected to the middleware.

<a name="2"></a>
###ImStatus_Off
    GUID: '2'
The _Off_ status indicates that the connection is currently off.

<a name="8"></a>
###ImStatus_OffRequest
    GUID: '8'
The _Off Request_ status indicates that the connection is being stopped.

<a name="10"></a>
###ImStatus_On
    GUID: '10'
The _On_ status indicates that the connection is fully functional and able
to exchange data with the device.

###ImStatus_OnRequest
    GUID: '7'
The _On Request_ status indicates that the connection is being initialized.

<a name="3"></a>
###ImStatus_OutOfOrder
    GUID: '3'
The _Out of Order_ status indicates that the connection is experiencing
recurring trouble and is not expected to become functional again for a
long time.
  - This differs from the [Off](#2) status because restoring the connection
 is not just a matter of re-starting the connection.
  - This differs from the [Out of Service](#4) status because this indicates
 that the connection is still needed, but unavailable for reasons out of
 the control of the lab.

<a name="4"></a>
###ImStatus_OutOfService
    GUID: '4'
The _Out of Service_ status indicates that the connection has been shut down
for an unspecified amount of time, because it is no longer needed.
  - This differs from the [Out Of Order](#3) status because it indicates that
 the connection has been shut down willingly, and is not needed anymore.
  - This differs from the IMOutOfService boolean status, which indicates
 that the connection has been removed from routing.

<a name="0"></a>
###ImStatus_Unknown

## Definitions
### Metric

The definition of a metric.

  - `id` *(string)* : An opaque, unique ID that identifies the definition.
  <ul>
  <li>The unique ID is a GUID; it is expressed in hexadecimal, lowercase, including dashes as separators.</li>
  <li>When issuing a POST query, the ID should normally be omitted; the service will then generate a new, unique ID.
      Otherwise, the ID must be different from those of the already existing definitions. </li>
  <li>When issuing a PUT query, the ID must match the one specified in the path or be omitted.</li>
  </ul>
  - `kind` *(string)* : The unique ID of the Metric kind of this metric.  - `name` *(string)* : The usual name for the definition. This usual name needs to make
  sense for an end user.
  <ul>
  <li>Multiple definitions may share the same name if they reference two objects that are never used in the same context.</li>
  <li>Usual names should never be left empty.</li>
  <li>Usual names have no fixed size limit, but should not normally exceed 50 characters or glyphs.</li>
  </ul>
  - `resource` *(string)* : The unique ID of the resource monitored by this metric.  - `shortname` *(string)* : A shorter version of the usual name. This may be used instead of
  the usual name where space is constrained, eg in grids.
  <ul>
  <li>If no short name is given, the usual name is used instead, but may be truncated as needed.</li>
  <li>Short names have no fixed size limit, but should not normally exceed 12 characters or glyphs.</li>
  </ul>
  - `sortkey` *(string)* : An arbitrary string that is used to sort lists of definitions.
  Definitions are sorted according to the increasing value of this
  key.
  <ul>
  <li>When two definitions share the same sortkey (and especially when their sortkey is empty, which is the usual case)
      they are sorted according to their usual name using localized conventions.</li>
  <li>Value should consist exclusively of printable ASCII characters.</li>
  <li>Lexicographic sort is used, implying that `item9` is after `item10`</li>
  <li>The sortkey is never meant to be shown to the end user, only to admins during setup.</li>
  </ul>
  - `systematicname` *(string)* : A systematized version of the name of the definition.
  <ul>
  <li>This is used in global contexts, when it is imperative to correctly disambiguate what is shown, typically during setup.</li>
  <li>If the systematic name is not given, the usual name is used instead.</li>
  <li>The systematic name is not meant to be shown to the end user, although it may be displayed when advanced details are requested.</li>
  </ul>

### MetricKind

The kind (aka type) of a Metric. Examples include “% CPU”, “InQ size“.

  - `id` *(string)* : An opaque, unique ID that identifies the definition.
  <ul>
  <li>The unique ID is a GUID; it is expressed in hexadecimal, lowercase, including dashes as separators.</li>
  <li>When issuing a POST query, the ID should normally be omitted; the service will then generate a new, unique ID.
      Otherwise, the ID must be different from those of the already existing definitions. </li>
  <li>When issuing a PUT query, the ID must match the one specified in the path or be omitted.</li>
  </ul>
  - `name` *(string)* : The usual name for the definition. This usual name needs to make
  sense for an end user.
  <ul>
  <li>Multiple definitions may share the same name if they reference two objects that are never used in the same context.</li>
  <li>Usual names should never be left empty.</li>
  <li>Usual names have no fixed size limit, but should not normally exceed 50 characters or glyphs.</li>
  </ul>
  - `shortname` *(string)* : A shorter version of the usual name. This may be used instead of
  the usual name where space is constrained, eg in grids.
  <ul>
  <li>If no short name is given, the usual name is used instead, but may be truncated as needed.</li>
  <li>Short names have no fixed size limit, but should not normally exceed 12 characters or glyphs.</li>
  </ul>
  - `sortkey` *(string)* : An arbitrary string that is used to sort lists of definitions.
  Definitions are sorted according to the increasing value of this
  key.
  <ul>
  <li>When two definitions share the same sortkey (and especially when their sortkey is empty, which is the usual case)
      they are sorted according to their usual name using localized conventions.</li>
  <li>Value should consist exclusively of printable ASCII characters.</li>
  <li>Lexicographic sort is used, implying that `item9` is after `item10`</li>
  <li>The sortkey is never meant to be shown to the end user, only to admins during setup.</li>
  </ul>
  - `systematicname` *(string)* : A systematized version of the name of the definition.
  <ul>
  <li>This is used in global contexts, when it is imperative to correctly disambiguate what is shown, typically during setup.</li>
  <li>If the systematic name is not given, the usual name is used instead.</li>
  <li>The systematic name is not meant to be shown to the end user, although it may be displayed when advanced details are requested.</li>
  </ul>

### MetricValue



  - `id` *(string)* : The internal ID of the metric. This is only returned by GET queries,
  and ignored in PUT queries.
  - `name` *(string)* : The usual name, retrieved from the metric definition. This is
  returned by GET queries, and only used by PUT queries if the metric
  is auto-created.
  - `timestamp` *(string)* : The date and time when the metric value was obtained.
  - `value` *(number)* : The acquired value. Note that contrary to KPIs, only numerical
  values are accepted.


## Paths

### GET /_healthcheck











Responses:

- `200`: Success

### GET /_version











Responses:

- `200`: Success

### GET /api/metric/1.0/metrickinds







Query Params:

  - `page` : The page number in the list to return.
This is used for pagination, to avoid returning too many entries
when querying a data resource list.
<ul>
<li>This value, along with the `pagesize` parameter, determines the subset of items returned by the query.</li>
<li>The first page is numbered as 0.</li>
<li>It is legal to query for a page beyond the end of the list; in that case, an empty subset is returned.</li>
</ul>


  - `pagesize` : The size of an individual page. This is the maximum number of items
that will be returned at once.
<ul>
<li>This is used in conjuction with the `page` parameter to determine the range of items to return.</li>
<li>When less that this maximum number of items are returned, the end of the list has been reached.</li>
</ul>


  - `first` : The index of the first item to return.
<ul>
<li>This is an alternate to querying by a `page` number, and allows the query to start at any arbitrary position.</li>
<li>This parameter is ignored if a page number is given.</li>
<li>The very first item is numbered 0.</li>
<li>It is legal to query for items past the end of the list; an empty subset will be returned in that case.</li>
</ul>


  - `last` : The index of the first item where to stop the list.
<ul>
<li>This item will _not_ be returned.</li>
<li>The value of `last` should be used as the value of `first` to obtain the next items in the list.</li>
<li>The parameter is ignored if `page` is specified.</li>
<li>If not specified, defaults to `first` + `pagesize`.</li>
<li>Less than last-first items will be returned if the end of the list has been reached.</li>
<li><b>Known issue</b>: This parameter is ignored if the `first` parameter is absent or zero.</li>
</ul>
